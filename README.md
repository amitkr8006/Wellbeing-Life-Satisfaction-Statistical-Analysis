# Life Satisfaction Drivers and Group Differences (Statistical Testing)

This project is an analysis focused on wellbeing and life satisfaction. It applies hypothesis testing and regression modelling to examine how lifestyle and demographic factors (children at home, smoking, education, marital status, gender) relate to life satisfaction, and it interprets results using model fit, effect sizes, and diagnostics.

## Objectives
- Select appropriate statistical methods based on research questions and variable types.
- Check assumptions and diagnostics (e.g., homogeneity, multicollinearity, influential points).
- Interpret outputs clearly using p-values, effect sizes, and regression coefficients.

## Methods Used
- Chi-square test (children-at-home × smoking association)
- Multiple regression (predicting life satisfaction from optimism, self-esteem, perceived stress)
- Independent samples t-test (life satisfaction: children vs no children)
- One-way ANOVA (life satisfaction across education levels)
- Two-way ANOVA + Tukey post-hoc (life satisfaction by marital status and gender)

## Key Findings (Highlights)
- Children-at-home is significantly associated with smoking; smoking is less likely when children are present.
- Life satisfaction is significantly predicted by optimism (+), self-esteem (+), and perceived stress (−), explaining ~35% variance.
- Life satisfaction did not significantly differ between those with children vs without in this sample.
- Education level was not a significant driver of life satisfaction at the 0.05 level.
- Marital status significantly affected life satisfaction; gender and interaction effects were not significant.

## Outcome
A complete, evidence-based statistical report showing correct test selection, diagnostics awareness, and practical interpretation for wellbeing-related questions.
